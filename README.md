# Password Generator

This repository contains three versions of the same Password Generator: 
- The `password_generator_terminal.py` is a simple command line program.
- The files inside "Made with Pygame" folder are the the same program but adapted to a pygame interface.
- The files inside "Made with Flask" folder are the same program but adapted to a Flask web app. The `app.py` is the Flask server

## Setup
